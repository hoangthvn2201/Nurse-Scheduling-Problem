# Nurse Scheduling Problem
## A submission for round 1 of the Math Modelling 2024 Contest
In this project, my colleagues and I try to use constraint programming methods to solve the problem posed by the contest: scheduling work for 80 employees in a hospital including main doctors and assistant doctors. and nurses of 4 departments in August and September.

Our solution needs to satisfy: 

 -Hard Contraint: Each shift in a day need to have enough 4 roles: 1 main doctor, 1 assistant doctor, 2 nurses.

 -Each shift should have diverse members from all 4 departments, as well as members
many seniorities. (Soft Constraint)

 -The schedule needs to be reasonable in personnel rotation, no one has to be on duty too much
like too little. (Soft Constraint)
